# ⚡ Supercharge Your GitHub Actions

CarbonRunner is built for **speed, savings, and sustainability** — with multi-cloud resilience you can trust.

By dynamically routing your GitHub Actions across **AWS, Azure, GCP, Heata**, and our own network, we send jobs to the **lowest-carbon regions in real time**.

The result: **up to 90% fewer emissions** — and lower costs.

CarbonRunner isn’t just CI/CD.

It’s **modern, resilient, carbon-aware CI** — redefining what Actions can do.
